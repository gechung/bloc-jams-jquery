# bloc-jams-jquery-starter
A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app

Goals were to find the pros and cons of using a helper library as well as using jQuery selectors correctly and understanding the object(s) returned.

Assembled this player using jQuery as a learning moment- jQuery is indeed efficient, and imperative to learn as a developer.
